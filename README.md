# Power BI Commerce Dashboard

&emsp;In this commerce data analysis project, I began by sourcing a dataset from kaggle
After carefully cleaning and processing the data to ensure accuracy, I utilized it to create a user-friendly Power BI dashboard. This dashboard visually presented key commerce metrics, sales trends, and customer insights. \
&emsp;This project served as an excellent opportunity for me to practice and refine my Power BI skills.
